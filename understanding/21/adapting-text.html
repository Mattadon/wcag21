      <h1>Understanding Adapting text</h1>
      <section id="intent">
         <h2>Intent</h2>
         <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to help ensure that people with disabilities who override spacing or font family (also called font face or typeface) can read text. It provides a spacing buffer. Increased spacing between lines, words, and letters has benefits for people who override author settings via user stylesheet, bookmarklet, extension, or application. They may need to change font family (e.g. to a wider one) than the author has set to effectively read text. They may increase spacing between lines, words, and letters to effectively read text. Line spacing also helps with tracking. Tracking is following along lines of text, including getting from the end of one line to the beginning of the next line.</p>
         <p>For this Success Criterion the canvas implementation of text is considered  to be <a>images of text</a>. </p>
