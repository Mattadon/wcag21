		<h1>Understanding Interruptions (Minimum)</h1>
		<section id="intent">
			<h2>Intent</h2>
			<p class="instructions">This section contains the main explanatory content of the Understanding. It explains why the Guideline or Success Criterion exists and, at a high level, how to meet it.</p>
			<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is that people with impaired attention and memory can complete a task. When users are interrupted, they may forget what they are doing and abandon the task. This can happen even when the original task is extremely important. For example, a user is making a doctor's appointment, but interruptions cause the user to forget what they were doing and the critical appointment is not made.</p>
			<p>From Etsi “Presented information is free from distractions if the information is presented so that required information will be perceived without other presented information interfering with its perception. Distractions from a user's point of view can result from distracting events and from information overload. Freedom from distraction involves minimizing distractions and avoiding distractions.”</p>
			<p>Where a site may generate interruptions and changes of content, the user must be able to easily turn them off to control them, such that: </p>
			<ol>
				<li>Interruptions can be easily controlled and turned off </li>
				<li>Secondary content (such as special offers or complementary material) can be easily identified, controlled and turned off </li>
				<li>No sudden changes occur on the site </li>
				<li>Media events can be easily controlled and turned off </li>
				<li>Chat can be easily turned off and on again </li>
				<li>Non-critical messages can easily be turned off and on again </li>
				<li>Where standard techniques exists for the above, they should be used </li>
				<li>Further pop-ups and similar distractions must always be easy to close and avoid so that all people can continue their task.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It is worth noting that the task force is proposing semantics to support an integrated solution. This is a proposal to help people stay focused and productive. It is based on a matrix for distractions at the operating system, browser, or cloud level. Currently people can turn off distractions such as Skype, and Facebook, across different devices, and then may forget to turn them back on. This idea manages all distractions by forming a cross-application and cross-device distraction matrix that manages all distractions in one setting. People and users can be clustered in terms of importance or groups. For example, the CEO and your child's care giver could both be considered critical contacts. So even if they do not feel the message is urgent, they can sometimes disrupt the user anyway. Some family members and important colleagues can be in another group, friends and extended family in a third group, system messages from the compliance system can be a different group again. </p>
			<p>Dimensions in the matrix can include: Groups of contacts, how urgent the contact feels any message is, and the level of interruptions the user can tolerate at any given time or setting. The user can set how to handle any combination of the above for the level of concentration needed at the time. For example, during normal work hours, messages from important colleagues could interrupt the user, but any other messages would get logged and read when the user has time. In another example, the user may be giving a talk and sets the interruption level to critical. Then, only critical messages from key colleagues and family can interrupt (for example, messages that a critical contact feels are critical and urgent). Default systems can include setting work hours. Optionally, distractions such as news websites could also be limited in low distraction times. </p>
			<p>Further pop-ups and similar distractions must always be consistently easy to close and avoid so that all people can continue their task.</p>
      
      <h2>Content added from the "easily available" definition</h2>
      <p>This Success Criterion requires that content is authored in ways that allow users to postpone or suppress interruptions. Content that does not present any interrupting content will satisfy this success criteria completely, but when interruptions are part of the content, users need to be able to control when these interruptions will occur.</p>
      <p>For a mechanism to be available in order to satisfy this Success Criterion one or more of the following should be true:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The user can set their preference one time with as wide a scope as possible (such as using the standards
         of the operating system, from <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=64840">ISO 9241-112</a> [[ISO_9241-112]] or <a href="http://gpii.net/"><abbr title="Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure">GPII</abbr></a> [[GPII]] when available).</li>
        <li>The user has the option to save or change the setting, where available interoperably, but also for the scope of the set of web pages.</li> <!-- we need to clarify what "where available interoperably" means -->
        <li>The user can reach a preference setting for each screen where it is needed.</li>
      </ul>

				<h3>Benefits</h3>
				<p class="instructions">This explains how following the success criterion benefits particular types of users with disabilities.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Distractions can cause people with cognitive disabilities to lose focus on the current action being performed or draw attention away from the primary content and can be difficult for some users to know how to understand, avoid and/or stop them. Drawing the user's attention away from primary content can create a range of issues depending on the user's impairment(s). If a user also has a low short term memory they may forget what task they are doing, and be unable to continue. If a user is consuming content and their attention is drawn away this may impact their ability to consume the primary content or complete an interaction or process. If a user is carrying out a complete multi-step action (such as form filling), being distracted may cause the user to lose context, thread or position in the action or sequence of actions. </li>
					<li>
						<p>Once people have become distracted it can be difficult for them to remember what they were doing. This is especially problematic for people with both low attention and impaired memory such as people with dementia.</p>
					</li>
					<li>Attention is affected for most people with cognitive disabilities, including dementia and ADHD. Other people with disabilities may find it hard to focus with a high-arousal page with moving text and animated images. This is fully discussed in the <a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/issue-papers/distractions.html">Distraction</a> Issue paper</li>

			<h2>Techniques</h2>
			<div class="instructions">
				<p>This section references techniques that can be used to meet the Guideline or Success Criterion. There are sub-sections for sufficient techniques, advisory techniques, and failures. </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Within each sub-section, there may be "situations" to describe when a set of techniques need to be considered. Remove the sub-section and heading if situations are not used.</li>
					<li>Techniques are provided in an unordered list. Reference techniques by linking to the filename of the technique and using the technique ID as link text. Use unlinked plain text if the technique has not been written yet.</li>
					<li>If more than one technique must be used for full sufficiency, list them in the same bullet separated by "AND".</li>
					<li>If a general technique requires technology-specific techniques to be implemented, end the bullet with "using" and provide a sub-list of those techniques.</li>
					<li>Square brackets indicate optional components.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Remove any parts of the template that are not used, such as the section and heading for situations, sub-lists of techniques, or the "AND" construction. Also remove the square brackets around placeholder optional components.</p>
