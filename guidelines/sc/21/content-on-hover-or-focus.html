      <p>When content becomes visible when triggered by a <a>user interface component</a> receiving keyboard focus or pointer hover, the following are true, except where the visual presentation of the content is controlled by the user agent and is not modified by the author:</p>

  <dl>

    <dt>Visible trigger</dt>
    <dd>Either the additional content does not obscure any <a>essential</a> content within the triggering <a>user interface component</a>, or the additional content can be closed or repositioned by the user.</dd>

    <dt>Hover</dt>
   <dd>If the additional content is triggered via pointer hover, then that content remains visible when the pointer is moved over it.</dd>

    <dt>Focus</dt>
    <dd>The additional content remains visible while the triggering user interface component has keyboard focus, unless the user dismisses the additional content.</dd>

  </dl>

      <p class="note">Examples of additional content controlled by the user agent include browser tooltips created through use of the HTML title attribute.</p>
     <p class="note">Custom tooltips, sub-menus, and other nonmodal popups which display on hover and focus are examples of additional content covered by this criterion.</p>
